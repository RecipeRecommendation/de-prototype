# DE_Prototype (Recipe Recommendation System)

The inspiration that led us to choose this project is that in our day-to-day life we came across many people that found it difficult to decide what to cook on the basis of the ingredients that they have in their refrigerator. This problem leads to day-to-day hustle of finding and selecting recipes. In addition, we also observed that people found it very difficult to remember the ingredients that they have in the refrigerator while buying groceries.

In order to solve these day-to-day problems, we have come up with a system that suggests recipes based on what ingredients are present in the refrigerator. 

Briefing more about our project, it provides a fully auto- mated system that relieves the users from buying the grocery by themselves by automating it and adding the ingredients that are less in the refrigerator to their Big Basket cart. Users can review the cart and place an order. The system also provides a recommender that studies user’s history and recommends recipes to them.

### Our prototype consists of 5 parts:
- Object Detection
- Recipe Recommendation
- Web Crawler using Selenium • Flask
- Google Firebase
- Mobile Application
